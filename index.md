# Litzi Cruz's Portfolio 

I am a computer science student at CSUF and I expect to graduate by 2026

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1
  
  When working on this lab I really enjoyed that we eventually figured out how to compile the program to say “Hello Litzi and Sara”, it really is a highlight that felt like the first step into computer science. I also enjoyed that since we were both fully unaware of how to code, we took a while to figure it out. And reflecting back, I now realize that if I were presented with the same lab I would be able to complete it in less than a minute. It really is a lookback from where we started and I appreciate how far we came. 

* Lab 2
  
  For this lab, I appreciated the lab partner I got, he really did help me understand through each step what we were working on and eventually by the end of the lab, I had a deeper understanding of the lab. This lab was also very fun to work on because we would initialize some input and expect a certain output that was pretty humorous. Overall this lab was a great experience for a beginner lab 

* Lab 12
  
  The Final lab was also one of my favorites. I found it very interesting to compile the program to not only create a flipbook that looked as though it was moving but also the Textfile name that said the name of our class with what looked like static in the back. I found both of these programs very interesting since they helped me get a better understanding of how visuals work on devices, simply being a series of pixels that ar
